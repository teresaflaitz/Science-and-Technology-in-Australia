        <p>Science and technology are most definitely topics of interest in Australia right now, as most news sites have entire sections dedicated to this type of content. News sources post a collection of articles, videos, and podcasts that cover a variety of specific topics within the STEM fields. The most prevalent of these topics, as determined within a five-week period from mid-August to late September, serve as the categories under which relevant sources curated (and their links) are filed on this website. Each section includes an analysis to point out the underlying themes connecting the news pieces to each other. Through this examination, it becomes clear Australia has a large research and innovation culture. As stated in ‘Eureka Prizes 2018: Five awesome winning innovations from Australian researchers’, Australia is “a world leader in research”. In addition, space exploration, climate change, cancer and Alzheimer’s research, and technology’s pros and cons are all topics that are currently at the front of the public’s mind. The prevalence of these topics stems from both the course of world events as well as from personal goals Australians are or have been striving towards within recent times. No matter the topic, it seems Australia is actively working towards pushing the bounds of scientific discovery to establish their dominance on the world stage and make life better for its residents. </p>

    <p>Based on the media collected throughout this five-week period, it is obvious Australia is a forward-thinking country that is heavily involved in the development of new technologies. The 2018 Australian Museum Eureka Prize ceremony celebrated a variety of scientists for contributions in fields ranging from biodiversity to nanotechnology. Australians are enthusiastic about the potential technology has for good and news articles reflect that. Browsing an Australian news site, one can learn about facial-recognition technology that can stop a distracted driver from crashing or about a new app that could keep Australia’s many indigenous languages from dying out. However, Australians do not let their excitement blind them from the potential dangers that technology may bring, especially with certain events that are currently taking place in China (discussed further in the ‘China’ section of this website). Articles about technology not focused on the positive impacts occurring right now instead focus on the negative impacts which may or may not occur in the future. As technology expands, Australians want to be sure they end up on top as far as job security and civil rights are concerned. Thus, news media gives advice on which careers will be needed in the future and conferences, like one held in Sydney, take place to discuss how much power robots should be given.

    <p>There is a sort of mysticism in Australia regarding space and the things that come from it. According to ‘After meteor lights up Perth sky, hunt begins for meteorite that crashed to Earth’, “Rumors about an enormous iron meteorite the size of a car lying somewhere on the Nullarbor Plain began circulating in the mid-1940s”. A meteorite fitting this description was indeed found in 1966, a finding that would certainly be enough to inspire anybody to look up to the sky in awe. Today, the same sense of enthusiasm persists and when a fireball (as Australians say) streaked across the sky in late August, a news article published on the subject suggested some civilians intended to set out on the same type of search. Later, it was updated to reflect that moving a meteorite is illegal unless one intends to turn it in to a museum. However, as a whole, Australia is still very much enamored with the idea of space, and the country’s pride in being a leading innovator has caused outrage over the fact that Australia was behind other countries as far as space exploration is concerned. Now, with the launch of the Australian Space Agency, the question of how to promote space exploration, from new government entities as well as from preestablished private sector entities, is a hot topic of discussion.</p>

    <p>The current news concerning nature in Australia focuses heavily on the unlucky state of the weather and protecting the environment. Although Perth had record breaking rain for the month of August, Australia is experiencing a drought and weather reports show no indication of it stopping anytime soon. Thus, it makes sense for scientists to look towards other, more long-term solutions. Researchers studied the correlation between the number of trees in a given area and the amount of rainfall that area, as well as surrounding locations, received. Unfortunately, studies showed that their hopes of a promising solution were mostly without warrant, as it is likely forest regeneration wouldn’t result in a significant increase in rainfall. However, Australians’ relationship with nature extends far past how the environment relates to the drought. The article ‘Fossil record points to 'major transformation' of Australian ecosystems in next 100 years’ reminds readers of conflicts surrounding the Paris Climate agreement and how science and politics intertwine. A recent study shows that Australia might be more prone to climate change than other regions, so this type of tension is sure to come up again in the future. On a more local scale, ‘Powerful owls' unlikely home in city suburbs leads to call for citizen scientists to track activity’ takes note of an initiative to involve civilians in tracking the whereabouts of Powerful owls, in order to catalogue their resurgence in the urban fields of Australia.</p>

    <p>Health-related media collected from Australian news sources throughout the designated five-week period centered around high-impact diseases like Alzheimer’s and cancer. As mentioned before, Australia has a very successful research community and many of the articles focused on ongoing research that might contribute to a cure in the future. For example, ‘Super memory is a curse and blessing for just 60 people worldwide, including Rebecca Sharrock’ mentions research being done on people with highly superior autobiographical memory (H-SAM) at the University of Queensland. Scientists in charge of this study hope to gain a better understanding of memory and how it works so that they can apply their findings to real-world problems like the Alzheimer’s disease. Another study, summarized in ‘Have we got Alzheimer's disease all wrong?’, also focuses on curing Alzheimer’s. It proposes that the brain plaque currently defined as the cause of the disease is really just a symptom. This norm-challenging assertion supports the idea that Australia is constantly working to push past scientific boundaries. To aid in achieving progress in a specific field of research, Australia’s Cancer Council is launching a map that displays the most common types of cancer in each area, as well as survival rates. Clearly, Australia has all the tools to churn out more groundbreaking research in the coming years.</p>

    <p>This section focuses on interesting finds that didn’t fit into any other category but were still notable for the common sense of discovery they shared. It can generally be said that humans are curious, and these sources show that residents of Australia are no different. Each article is a different representation of how people love figuring stuff out and therefore, love hearing about stuff that has been figured out. The first two articles cover more serious topics. Paleontologists would be excited to hear about the categorization of Dickinsonia as the first known animal based on fat cells found on a fossil, while archaeologist would love to read about the possible discovery of Captain James Cook’s HMS Endeavour. The third story however, is more common interest and epitomizes science’s fascination with the simple yet bizarre. An orange purchased in a Brisbane shop turned purple after being peeled and cut open. After running tests on the orange slices, scientists determined that a reaction had taken place between the chemicals that color the fruit and metals on the knife, which had recently been sharpened. In short, there is something for everyone to read about in Australian science news.</p>

    <p>Science and technology news related to China is prevalent right now due to the political climate between the two nations. Browsing through an Australian news site, one would get the impression that, although Australians fully acknowledge how impressive China’s technological development is, they do not fully trust or agree with how China uses its technology. In ‘Why Australia blocked China's Huawei from super-fast mobile’, the Australian government’s fear of Chinese espionage is declared. Australians choose to pass up the cheaper progress provided by the cell phone company Huawei in order to make sure China does not have any inside access to their data. In ‘Leave no dark corner’, Australians showcase even more trepidation towards Chinese technology. A social credit system is being implemented in China that will monitor Chinese citizens in real-time and assign them a numerical score describing how good of a citizen they are. This idea, while acceptable to many Chinese citizens, contradicts Australians’ ideas regarding freedom. It will be interesting to see how this political, cultural, and technological dynamic evolves as times passes.</p>
